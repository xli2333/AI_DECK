# Bain Style Traffic Light Matrix Table

## Visual Description
A dense data table or matrix that uses visual indicators (arrows, colored dots, or "traffic lights") instead of just numbers to show trends, performance, or status. This is a classic Bain layout for summarizing complex qualitative and quantitative assessments across multiple regions or categories.

## Element Breakdown
1.  **Slide Title**: High-level synthesis of the performance (e.g., "China Leads Growth While Europe Stalls").
2.  **Matrix Grid**:
    *   **Rows**: Categories, Brands, or Customer Segments.
    *   **Columns**: Regions (Americas, Europe, China, etc.) or Metrics (Growth, Share, Profitability).
3.  **Visual Indicators (The "Traffic Lights")**:
    *   **Green/Up Arrow** or **+++**: Strong positive performance.
    *   **Yellow/Flat Arrow** or **~**: Stable/Neutral performance.
    *   **Red/Down Arrow** or **-**: Negative/Weak performance.
    *   *Note*: Bain often uses simple colored circles or bold arrows rather than literal traffic lights.
4.  **Highlighting**:
    *   A specific row or column (e.g., China) might be enclosed in a thick black or red border to draw attention.
5.  **Footer/Sidebar**:
    *   "Key Drivers" text explaining *why* certain areas are red or green.

## Usage Context
*   Regional performance reviews.
*   Brand portfolio analysis.
*   Risk assessment across different business units.
*   Comparing "Local" vs "Tourist" spending trends.

## Prompt
```markdown
Create a 'Traffic Light' matrix table slide in Bain & Company style.

Visual Layout:
- **Table Structure**: A matrix with [Rows: Product Categories] and [Columns: Regions/Markets].
- **Indicators**: Instead of raw numbers, use visual icons in the cells:
  - **Strong Growth**: Bold Up Arrow (Green or Black) or "+++"
  - **Stable**: Horizontal Arrow or "~"
  - **Decline**: Down Arrow (Red) or "-"
- **Focus Area**: Draw a heavy border (black or red) around the column for [Focus Region, e.g., China] to highlight it as the outlier or leader.
- **Title**: "[Insight about the diverging performance, e.g., Asia Outperforms Western Markets]".
- **Legend**: Small legend at the bottom explaining the symbols.
- **Commentary**: A sidebar listing "Main Drivers" for the observed trends.

Style Constraints:
- Clean, grid-based layout.
- Icons should be large and legible.
- Use Bain's red color sparingly for negative trends or high-impact highlights.
