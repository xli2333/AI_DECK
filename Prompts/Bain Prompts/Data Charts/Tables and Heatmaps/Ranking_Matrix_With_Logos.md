# Bain Style Ranking Matrix with Logos

## Visual Description
A structured table that ranks top players (brands, companies, competitors) across different categories using their logos. This visualizes "Who is winning where" without needing complex bar charts for every single category.

## Element Breakdown
1.  **Rows**: Market segments or Product Categories (e.g., Watches, Jewelry, Apparel).
2.  **Columns**: Ranking positions (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.).
3.  **Cell Content**:
    *   Company/Brand Logos placed centrally in the cells.
    *   Alternatively, plain text names if logos are not available, but logos are preferred for impact.
4.  **New Entrants**:
    *   Use of a small "star" or "burst" icon (often red or yellow) attached to a logo to indicate a "NEW" entry into the top ranks.
5.  **Headers**: Simple grey bars for column headers.

## Usage Context
*   Competitor landscape analysis.
*   Market share leadership by category.
*   Tracking changes in leadership over time (e.g., "2020 Rankings").
