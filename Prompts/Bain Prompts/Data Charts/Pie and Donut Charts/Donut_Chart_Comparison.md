# Bain Style Donut Chart Comparison

## Visual Description
A side-by-side comparison of two or more donut charts, used to contrast market share, demographics, or categorical splits between two scenarios (e.g., "Traditional" vs "Modern", "Region A" vs "Region B"). The design relies on Bain's signature red and grey palette to highlight specific segments.

    *   **Color**: One segment highlighted in **Bain Red**, others in shades of grey.
    *   **Center Label**: Optional total value or key percentage inside the donut hole.
3.  **Data Labels**:
    *   Percentage values placed clearly outside or inside the segments.
    *   Category names connected with thin leader lines if necessary.
4.  **Commentary**:
    *   A textual summary or "Key Takeaways" box (often on the right or bottom) explaining the shift.
    *   Use of red bold text for emphasis.

## Prompt
```markdown
Create a slide comparing two donut charts side-by-side in Bain & Company style.

Visual Layout:
- **Left Chart**: A donut chart representing [Scenario A / Year X]. Highlight the [Specific Category] segment in Bain Red (#CC0000), with other segments in light grey and dark grey.
- **Right Chart**: A donut chart representing [Scenario B / Year Y]. Highlight the same [Specific Category] segment in Bain Red to show the change in proportion.
- **Center Data**: Place the total value or main percentage in the center of each donut.
- **Labels**: Use clean, sans-serif fonts for percentages. Place labels outside the ring if segments are small.
- **Title**: "[Action Title summarizing the shift, e.g., Online Penetration Doubles in 3 Years]".
- **Analysis**: On the far right or bottom, add a brief text block titled "Key Observations" with bullet points. Bold key numbers in red.

Style Constraints:
- Minimalist white background.
- Use a thin red line under the main title.
- Ensure the red segment is the focal point of the comparison.
