# Bain Style Regional Performance Dashboard

## Visual Description
A comprehensive view of performance across different geographies, combining list data with visual indicators like bubbles or maps. It allows for a quick "health check" of the global business.

## Element Breakdown
1.  **Columns/Modules**:
    *   The slide is divided into vertical columns or distinct boxes, one for each major region (e.g., Americas, Europe, China, Asia-Pacific).
2.  **Visual Anchors**:
    *   Top of each column: A representative image (circular crop) or icon (landmark/map) for the region.
3.  **Metrics (The Bubbles)**:
    *   **Market Size**: Large circular bubble showing revenue (e.g., €20B).
    *   **Growth**: Smaller colored pill or circle attached showing YoY growth (e.g., +10%).
    *   **Color Logic**: Red for high growth/focus areas, Grey for stable/low growth.
4.  **Text Detail**:
    *   Bullet points below the visuals listing specific drivers (e.g., "Exchange rate impact", "Tourism recovery").

## Usage Context
*   Quarterly Business Reviews (QBR).
*   Global market landscape overview.
*   identifying regional disparities.

## Prompt
```markdown
Create a Regional Performance Dashboard slide in Bain & Company style.

Visual Layout:
- **Grid**: Divide the slide into [Number] vertical columns, each representing a Region.
- **Header Image**: At the top of each column, place a circular grayscale photo or icon representing the region.

  - Attached to it, a smaller Red Bubble/Tag displaying the [Growth %].
- **Analysis**: Under the metrics, add a list of 3-4 bullet points summarizing key drivers.
- **Highlight**: If one region is outperforming (e.g., China), use a bold Red border or background highlight for that column.
- **Title**: "[Summary of regional performance, e.g., Asia Leads Global Recovery]".

Style Constraints:
