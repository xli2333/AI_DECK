# Bain Style Today vs Tomorrow Comparison

## Visual Description
A split-screen or multi-column layout comparing the current state ("Today") with the future aspirational state ("Tomorrow"). This is key for "Change Management" or "Vision" presentations.

## Element Breakdown
1.  **Columns**:
    *   **Left**: "TODAY" (or Yesterday/Current). Often has a grey or neutral header.
    *   **Right**: "TOMORROW" (or Future/Target). Often has a Red header to signify the goal.
2.  **Central Separator**:
    *   Sometimes a central graphic (like a vehicle, a bridge, or a time vortex) is used to symbolize the transition.
    *   Or simply a vertical line.
3.  **Content**:
    *   Parallel lists where each item on the left has a direct counterpart on the right.
    *   **Keywords**: Bolded to show the shift (e.g., "Manual" -> "Automated").
4.  **Visual Cues**:
    *   Arrows pointing from left to right.
    *   Background elements like "Word Clouds" floating behind the columns (optional).

## Usage Context
*   Digital transformation roadmaps.
*   Cultural change initiatives.
*   Business model pivots.
