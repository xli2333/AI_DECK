# Bain Style Two-Column Text Contrast

## Visual Description
A layout focusing on qualitative comparison using two large, distinct text boxes. This is often used to contrast "Challenges" vs "Opportunities" or "Market Headwinds" vs "Tailwinds".

## Element Breakdown
1.  **Containers**:
    *   Two large rounded rectangles or shaded boxes side-by-side.
    *   **Borders**: Often a thin Red border for one or both.
2.  **Headers**:
    *   Inside the box, a colored title bar (Red for the primary/positive side, Grey/Pink for the secondary side).
3.  **Content**:
    *   Mix of bullet points and quotes.
    *   Background images (watermarks/low opacity) inside the boxes (e.g., a pencil, a desk, a crowd) to add texture.
4.  **Quotes**:
    *   Italicized quotes from interviews or experts are common.

## Usage Context
*   Qualitative research findings.
*   SWOT analysis (specifically Strengths vs Weaknesses).
*   summarizing interview themes.

## Prompt
```markdown
Create a Two-Column Text Contrast slide in Bain & Company style.

Visual Layout:
- **Containers**: Two large vertical panels with rounded corners.
- **Left Panel**:
  - Header: "[Topic A, e.g., Market Headwinds]" (Grey background).
  - Content: List of challenges or negative factors.
- **Right Panel**:
  - Header: "[Topic B, e.g., Strategic Opportunities]" (Red background).
  - Content: List of positive drivers or solutions.
- **Visual Texture**: Add a subtle, low-opacity background image (e.g., relevant icon or photo) inside each panel.
- **Title**: "[Title synthesizing the contrast, e.g., Challenges Persist, but Opportunities Emerge]".

Style Constraints:
- Ample padding inside the text boxes.
- Use a clear hierarchy: Header -> Main Point -> Sub-bullet.
- Bain Red used primarily on the 'Opportunity/Positive' side.
