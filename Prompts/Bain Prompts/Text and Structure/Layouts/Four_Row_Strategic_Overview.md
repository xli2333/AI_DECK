# Bain Style Four-Row Strategic Overview

## Visual Description
A layout composed of four horizontal bands, often used to answer fundamental strategic questions (Who, What, Where, How). It breaks down a complex strategy into digestible, parallel streams.

## Element Breakdown

    *   Often accompanied by a red sub-header.
3.  **Content (Right Side)**:
    *   Detailed text or bullet points explaining the strategy for that dimension.
4.  **Icons**:
    *   Optional subtle icons integrated into the header area.

## Usage Context
