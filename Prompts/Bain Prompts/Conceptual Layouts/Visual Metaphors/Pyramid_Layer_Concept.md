# Bain Style Pyramid Layer Concept

## Visual Description
A pyramid or inverted pyramid divided into horizontal layers, used to segment markets (typically by price point or exclusivity) or customer hierarchies.

## Element Breakdown
1.  **Shape**:
    *   A triangle/pyramid divided into 3-4 distinct layers.
    *   **Layers**: Typically labeled "Absolute" (Top), "Aspirational" (Middle), "Accessible" (Bottom).
2.  **Data Overlays**:
    *   **Size**: Market size (€ Billions) for each layer.
    *   **Growth**: Red circular bubbles floating next to each layer showing CAGR.
3.  **Comparison**:
    *   Often paired with a standard bar chart or another pyramid to show evolution (e.g., "2015 Pyramid" vs "2025 Pyramid").
4.  **Direction**:
    *   Arrows (often hand-drawn style or simple red arrows) indicating movement between layers (e.g., "Democratization" moving down, or "Up-trading" moving up).

## Usage Context
*   Luxury market segmentation.
*   Customer value pyramids.
*   Organizational hierarchy.
