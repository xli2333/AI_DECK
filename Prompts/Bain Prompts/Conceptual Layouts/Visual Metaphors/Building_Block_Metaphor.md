# Bain Style Building Block Metaphor

## Visual Description
A creative, visual layout using "building blocks" (often resembling Lego bricks) to represent components of a market, strategy, or portfolio. This is a distinctive "Bain signature" style found in several luxury reports.

## Element Breakdown
1.  **Visual Metaphor**:
    *   3D-rendered or stylized blocks/bricks.
    *   Stacked to form a shape (e.g., a wall, a tower, or an object like a car/shoe).
2.  **Labels**:
    *   Text directly overlaid on the blocks (e.g., Category Names: "Cars", "Hotels", "Wines").
3.  **Data Integration**:
    *   Sometimes the height or size of the block represents a value, but often it is purely illustrative to show *composition*.
    *   Accompanying text boxes or callouts explain the significance of specific "blocks."
4.  **Style**:
    *   Clean, white background.
    *   Blocks often use Bain's primary colors (Red) and secondary palette (Grey/Black), or realistic colors if using a specific "toy" theme.

## Usage Context
*   Explaining the components of a complex market (e.g., "The Building Blocks of Luxury").
*   Showing how different categories sum up to a whole.
*   Creative breaks in a presentation to engage the audience.
