# Bain Style Funnel Conversion Process

## Visual Description
A funnel chart depicting a narrowing process, such as customer acquisition or marketing conversion. Bain's variation often pairs the funnel with side-by-side data or splits the funnel to compare "Traditional" vs "Digital" paths.

## Element Breakdown
1.  **Funnel Shape**:
    *   Horizontal or Vertical trapezoids narrowing down.
    *   Stages: Awareness -> Consideration -> Purchase -> Loyalty.
2.  **Data Integration**:
    *   Percentages showing conversion rates between stages.
    *   Absolute numbers for the population at each stage.
3.  **Comparison (Dual Funnel)**:
    *   Two funnels side-by-side (e.g., Offline vs Online Journey) to show efficiency differences.
    *   Or a Donut Chart placed next to each funnel stage to show the "Digital Influence" share.
4.  **Color**:
    *   Stages often alternate in grey shades.
    *   Key drop-off points or high-performance areas highlighted in Red.

## Usage Context
*   Sales pipeline analysis.
*   Marketing efficiency review.
*   Recruitment process analysis.
