# Slide Layout: Bubble & Curve Combo Chart (Pareto Analysis)

**Category:** Data Insights > Scatter and Bubble
**Use Case:** Market Prioritization, Resource Allocation, "80/20" Rule Visualization
**Source:** BCGMOREMORE_Part12 (Page 16)

## 1. Context and Goal
This slide combines two powerful analytical views to justify a "Top 20" or "Top X" strategy. It argues that focusing on a small number of high-potential clusters will yield the majority of results.
*   **View 1 (Left):** A Pareto (cumulative) curve showing concentration.
*   **View 2 (Right):** A Scatter/Bubble plot showing the attractiveness vs. competition of those specific clusters.

## 2. Visual Structure (Layout Description)
Two distinct charts side-by-side, sharing a common color coding logic.

### Detailed Element Breakdown

#### A. The Pareto Curve (Left)
*   **Chart Type:** Line Chart / Cumulative Distribution Curve.
*   **X-Axis:** "Rank Percentile (%)" or Number of Clusters (0 to 100).
*   **Y-Axis:** "Market Potential" (Cumulative %).
*   **The Curve:** A steep curve rising quickly and then flattening out (the classic "80/20" shape).
*   **Zoning:**
    *   **Zone 1:** "Top 20 Clusters". Highlight the area under the curve in **Orange**.
    *   **Zone 2:** "Top 65 Clusters". Highlight the area in **Blue**.
*   **Arrows/Annotations:** Red arrows pointing from the Y-axis to the curve, labeled "50% of potential" and "80% of potential".

#### B. The Bubble Scatter Plot (Right)
*   **Chart Type:** Bubble Chart.
*   **X-Axis:** "Competition: ease of market entry (by rank)".
*   **Y-Axis:** "Market Potential (Mn HL)".
*   **Bubbles:** Each bubble represents a cluster.
    *   **Size:** Can represent Volume or just be uniform.
    *   **Color:** Use colors to differentiate Regions (BU) - e.g., Blue for North, Red for South.
*   **Shading:** A shaded rectangular background area (e.g., top-left quadrant) to indicate the "Sweet Spot" (High Potential, Low Competition).
*   **Labels:** Callout lines pointing to specific key bubbles (e.g., "Tengzhou", "Yanshi").

#### C. The Insight Bar (Bottom)
*   **Action:** A wide, dark green bar at the bottom.
*   **Text:** "Higher potential yet less competitive clusters prioritized".

## 3. Key Design Instructions (For AI Generation)
*   **Linkage:** The "Top 20" zone in the Left Chart must conceptually match the "Sweet Spot" bubbles in the Right Chart.
*   **Contrast:** The orange/blue zoning on the left chart needs to be distinct.
*   **Detail:** The scatter plot should look "busy" but readable, implying a rigorous analysis of many data points.

## 4. Suggested Content (Placeholder)
*   **Left Chart:** Top 20 clusters account for ~50% of total potential. Top 65 account for ~80%.
*   **Right Chart:** Scatter plot showing high variation. Some high-potential markets have intense competition (bottom right), while others are open (top left).
