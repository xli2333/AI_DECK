# Slide Layout: Themed Geographic Heatmap (China)

**Category:** Data Insights > Market and Geo
**Use Case:** Regional Strategy, Market Prioritization, Footprint Analysis
**Source:** BCGMOREMORE_Part12 (Page 11)

## 1. Context and Goal
This slide uses a geographic map to visualize market priorities. It highlights specific provinces in different colors to denote their strategic status (e.g., Premium vs. Core markets) and pairs this visual with a summary data table.

## 2. Visual Structure (Layout Description)
A split layout: **Data Table (Left, ~30%)** and **Map Graphic (Right, ~70%)**.

### Detailed Element Breakdown

#### A. The Data Table (Left)
*   **Header:** Simple table header (e.g., "BU", "# Counties", "Volume").
*   **Rows:** List of Business Units (BU) or Regions (e.g., "CE", "NO", "W", "S").
*   **Summary Box:** A prominent box at the bottom or top left explaining the color legend.
    *   **Legend:** Small square swatches showing the map colors (Dark Red, Pink, Grey).
    *   **Text:** Definitions (e.g., "Dark Red = 30-45 prioritized counties").

#### B. The Map (Right)
*   **Base:** A clean, vector outline map of China, divided by province boundaries.
*   **Coloring:**
    *   **Target Provinces:** Fill specific provinces with the theme colors (e.g., Shandong in Dark Red, Hebei in Pink).
    *   **Non-Target:** Leave other provinces white or light grey.
*   **Callouts:**
    *   **Dashed Boxes:** Use red dashed rectangular boxes to "zoom in" or highlight specific clusters (e.g., outlining the Hebei/Shandong area).
    *   **Data Labels:** Inside or near the colored provinces, place small white text boxes containing key metrics (e.g., "Shandong: 49 Counties").
    *   **Leader Lines:** If the province is too small, use a line connecting the province to a text box placed in the ocean area.

#### C. The Title/Action Title
*   **Style:** BCG Standard Green Bar (optional) or plain text.
*   **Content:** A full sentence summarizing the insight (e.g., "~123 prioritized counties for Premium-only market").

## 3. Key Design Instructions (For AI Generation)
*   **Map Quality:** The map must be accurate. Province boundaries should be visible but subtle (thin grey lines).
*   **Contrast:** The colored provinces must stand out against the white/grey background.
*   **Data Integration:** The table and the map must tell the same story. If "North" is listed as high priority in the table, the northern provinces on the map must be colored accordingly.

## 4. Suggested Content (Placeholder)
*   **Map Highlights:**
    *   **Dark Red:** Shandong, Jiangsu (High Priority).
    *   **Pink:** Hebei, Anhui (Medium Priority).
    *   **Grey:** Xinjiang, Xizang (No Priority).
*   **Table Data:**
    *   **Total:** 123 Counties.
    *   **Vol:** 14.6 Mn HL.
