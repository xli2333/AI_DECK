# Slide Layout: Channel Mix Stacked Bar Chart

**Category:** Data Insights > Bar and Column Charts
**Use Case:** Portfolio Analysis, Channel Strategy, Sales Breakdown
**Source:** BCGMOREMORE_Part11 (Page 51)

## 1. Context and Goal
This slide analyzes the composition of sales across different channels (e.g., Traditional Trade, Key Accounts) for different product segments (Core vs. Premium). It validates assumptions by comparing high-level data with a specific "Deep Dive" example from a pilot city.

## 2. Visual Structure (Layout Description)
A split layout: **Macro Assumption (Left)** vs. **Micro Validation (Right)**.

### Detailed Element Breakdown

#### A. The Macro Chart (Left)
*   **Title:** "Assumption on channel mix".
*   **Chart Type:** 100% Stacked Column Chart.
*   **Grouping:** Two main clusters:
    1.  **Top Cluster:** "Core/Core+ Channel Mix".
    2.  **Bottom Cluster:** "Premium Channel Mix".
*   **Columns:** Represent time periods (e.g., "2012 H2", "2013 H1", "2013 H2").
*   **Segments:** Stacked blocks representing channels (e.g., NL, AB, C, D). Use different shades of green/grey.
*   **Labels:** Data labels (percentages) inside each block.

#### B. The Micro Validation (Right)
*   **Title:** "Validation: Mianzhu as an example".
*   **Visual Logic:** A "Calculation Flow" diagram.
    *   **Input Column:** "Total POCs" (Number of Points of Sale).
    *   **Multiplier:** "x" symbol.
    *   **Efficiency Column:** "Sales per POC".
    *   **Result Arrow:** An arrow pointing to the final result bar.
    *   **Output Chart:** A single wide stacked bar showing the calculated channel mix for that specific city.
*   **Annotations:** Small text explaining the calculation logic (e.g., "Tier 5 market, 14k HL volume").

#### C. Legend
*   **Location:** Bottom center or right.
*   **Items:** Small colored squares corresponding to the channel names (NL, AB, C, D, TT/KA).

## 3. Key Design Instructions (For AI Generation)
*   **Comparison:** The key visual goal is to show if the "Macro Assumption" (Left) matches the "Micro Validation" (Right). The colors and segment ordering must be identical in both charts to allow for easy eye-scanning comparison.
*   **Consistency:** Use the same color palette for channels across all charts.
*   **Separation:** Use a vertical divider line between the Left and Right sections.

## 4. Suggested Content (Placeholder)
*   **Channels:**
    *   **NL:** Nightlife (Dark Green).
    *   **AB:** Dining (Medium Green).
    *   **C:** Modern Trade (Light Green).
    *   **D:** Traditional Trade (Grey).
*   **Data:**
    *   **Premium Mix:** High % in Nightlife and Dining.
    *   **Core Mix:** High % in Dining and Traditional Trade.
