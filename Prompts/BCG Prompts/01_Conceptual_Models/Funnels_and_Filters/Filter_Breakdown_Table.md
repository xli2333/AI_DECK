# Slide Layout: Filter Breakdown Table (As-is vs To-be)

**Category:** Conceptual Models > Funnels and Filters
**Use Case:** Quantitative Filtering, Market Sizing Logic, Gap Analysis
**Source:** BCGMOREMORE_Part12 (Page 2)

## 1. Context and Goal
This slide presents a rigorous, data-driven filtering logic. Unlike a visual funnel, this uses a structured table to show the numerical reduction of a market opportunity step-by-step. It validates the "White Space" definition by showing exactly how many units (counties/cities/volume) remain after applying specific exclusion criteria.

## 2. Visual Structure (Layout Description)
The slide uses a **four-column structured table** layout with distinct headers and a "Total Pie" summary column on the far right.

### Detailed Element Breakdown

#### A. The Columns (Left to Right)
1.  **Column 1 (Definition):** A green header box. Below it, row labels describing the metrics (e.g., "# of counties", "Total Market Size", "Current Share").
2.  **Column 2 (As-is Status):** Header: "As-is". Shows the starting baseline numbers.
3.  **Column 3 (Filter Step 1):** Header: "As-is filtered by sales coverage". This column represents the first exclusion layer. Use a **dashed red border** around this column or specific cells to highlight the filtering action.
4.  **Column 4 (Filter Step 2):** Header: "As-is filtered by W/S coverage". Represents the second exclusion layer.
5.  **Column 5 (Total Pie):** Header: "Total pie". Shows the final addressable market sum or the total universe context.

#### B. The Rows (Metrics)
*   **Row 1:** Definition text (What defines this column?).
*   **Row 2:** Count Metric (e.g., Number of Cities). Large bold numbers.
*   **Row 3:** Volume Metric (e.g., Market Volume in HL). Large bold numbers, possibly split into two colors (Red/Black) to denote segments.
*   **Row 4:** Financial Metric (e.g., Revenue in RMB).
*   **Row 5:** Current Share (e.g., Current Share %).

#### C. Visual Cues
*   **Red Dashed Boxes:** Use dashed red outlines around specific columns or groups of data to indicate "This is the specific segment we are analyzing/excluding".
*   **Comparison Percentages:** Small parenthetical percentages (e.g., `(~75.8%)`) below the main numbers to show the portion relative to the total.
*   **Color Coding:** Use green for the leftmost label column and a bottom summary bar. Use standard black/grey for data, with red highlights for "Core" or "Premium" segments.

#### D. Bottom Summary Bar
*   **Action:** A wide, solid green bar spanning the bottom width of the slide.
*   **Text:** White text inside the bar summarizing the key insight (e.g., "Two types of whitespace identified: High Potential Premium & Core Market").

## 3. Key Design Instructions (For AI Generation)
*   **Alignment:** Strictly grid-based. Numbers must be center-aligned within their columns.
*   **Hierarchy:** The numbers should be the largest text on the slide (excluding the title).
*   **Separators:** Use dotted vertical lines between columns to separate the logic steps.
*   **Logic Flow:** The visual logic implies `Column 2` is a subset of `Column 5`, and `Column 3` and `Column 4` are specific slices of `Column 2`.

## 4. Suggested Content (Placeholder)
*   **Header:** "White Space" defined as counties without direct sales coverage.
*   **Col 2 Data:** 1731 Counties (75%).
*   **Col 3 Data:** 1389 Counties (Excluded due to sales coverage).
*   **Col 4 Data:** 1148 Counties (Excluded due to distributor coverage).
*   **Total Pie:** 2283 Total Counties.
