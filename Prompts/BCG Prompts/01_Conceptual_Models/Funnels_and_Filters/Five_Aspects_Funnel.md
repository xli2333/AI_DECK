# Slide Layout: Five Aspects Segmentation Funnel

**Category:** Conceptual Models > Funnels and Filters
**Use Case:** Market Filtering, Strategic Segmentation, Opportunity Screening
**Source:** BCGMOREMORE_Part12 (Page 3)

## 1. Context and Goal
This slide visually demonstrates a filtering process where a broad market opportunity is narrowed down through multiple specific criteria. It is used to explain *how* a target market was defined, moving from the total addressable market to a specific "white space" opportunity.

## 2. Visual Structure (Layout Description)
The slide is divided into two main sections:
*   **Left Side (The Visual Funnel):** A large, 3D-style funnel graphic divided into 5 distinct horizontal layers/slices.
*   **Right Side (The Explanation):** A structured list of text blocks corresponding to each layer of the funnel.

### Detailed Element Breakdown

#### A. The Funnel (Left)
*   **Shape:** A classic funnel shape, wide at the top and narrow at the bottom.
*   **Layers:** Divide the funnel into 5 horizontal bands (slices).
*   **Labels:** On the left side of each band, place a circular badge with a letter (A, B, C, D, E) to index the step.
*   **Text:** Inside each funnel band, write the short title of the filter criteria (e.g., "Market potential", "Supply capability").
*   **Color:** Use a monochromatic scale (e.g., shades of grey or brand color) that gets darker or lighter as it goes down, or use distinct professional colors for each band.

#### B. The Connection (Middle)
*   **Lines:** Dotted horizontal lines should extend from the right edge of each funnel band towards the right side of the slide. This visually connects the graphic slice to its detailed description.

#### C. The Details (Right)
*   **Heading:** At the top of the right section, place a header like "Key elements to consider".
*   **List Items:** For each of the 5 layers, provide a detailed bulleted list.
    *   **Format:** The text should align perfectly with the corresponding funnel layer.
    *   **Content:** Each block should explain the criteria used.
    *   **Highlight:** Use bold red text within the black text to highlight key constraints or critical factors (e.g., "sizable premium segment").

## 3. Key Design Instructions (For AI Generation)
*   **Distribution:** The funnel should occupy roughly 40% of the slide width on the left. The detailed text should occupy 60% on the right.
*   **Style:** Professional, flat or subtle 3D vector style. Clean lines.
*   **Typography:** Bold for the titles inside the funnel. Regular weight for the detailed description, with bold accents for emphasis.
*   **Constraint:** Ensure the horizontal alignment is perfect—the text block for "Step A" must be exactly level with the "Step A" funnel slice.

## 4. Suggested Content (Placeholder)
*   **Step A:** Market Potential (Is there sufficient demand?)
*   **Step B:** Supply Capability (Can we actually deliver product here?)
*   **Step C:** Profit Contribution (Will high-margin products sell?)
*   **Step D:** Competitive Landscape (Is competition too fierce?)
*   **Step E:** Wholesaler Presence (Are there partners to work with?)
