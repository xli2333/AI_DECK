# Slide Layout: Stepwise Prioritization Matrix

**Category:** Conceptual Models > Matrices and Grids
**Use Case:** Market Prioritization, Segmentation Strategy, Entry Sequence
**Source:** BCGMOREMORE_Part12 (Page 4)

## 1. Context and Goal
This slide visually segments a large number of markets (e.g., 1168 counties) into prioritized groups. Instead of a standard 2x2 matrix, it uses a **rectangular "step" or "cut-off" visual** to show how a large block of opportunity is sliced into "High Potential," "Medium," and "Low" based on specific criteria.

### 2. Visual Structure (Layout Description)
The layout is split into two halves: the **Visual Model** on the left and the **Methodology Text** on the right.

### Detailed Element Breakdown

#### A. The Visual Model (Left)
*   **Base Shape:** A large rectangle representing the total universe of "High potential markets".
*   **Slicing (The Steps):**
    *   **Cut 1 (Vertical):** A vertical dashed line separates "Low potential" (greyed out, left) from "High potential" (colored, right).
    *   **Cut 2 (Horizontal):** The "High potential" right side is further divided horizontally into distinct colored blocks.
        *   **Top Block (Green):** "Priority 1" (e.g., Supply both A & B). Use a dark green color.
        *   **Middle Block (Light Green):** "Priority 2" (e.g., Supply A only). Use a lighter green.
        *   **Bottom Block (Yellow):** "Priority 3" (e.g., No Supply). Use a yellow/gold color.
*   **Badges:** Place a small circular number badge (e.g., "1", "2") on the cut-lines to reference the methodology steps.
*   **Callout Tag:** A red "Priority" tag or arrow pointing specifically to the top green block to indicate it is the primary target.

#### B. The Methodology (Right)
*   **Structure:** A list of numbered steps corresponding to the badges on the visual model.
*   **Step 1 Block:** "Market Potential". Explains the vertical cut (e.g., "Cut-off line: 7,000 HL/county").
*   **Step 2 Block:** "Supply Capability". Explains the horizontal cuts (e.g., "Further cut-off by portfolio coverage").
*   **Formatting:** Use a bold header line for each step, followed by bullet points explaining the specific logic or threshold values.
*   **Footer Note:** A small text block at the bottom right titled "Cut-off line rationale" providing technical details (e.g., distance in Km).

#### C. Bottom Summary Bar
*   **Action:** A solid dark green bar across the bottom.
*   **Text:** White text summarizing the decision (e.g., "High potential markets with full line supply to be prioritized").

## 3. Key Design Instructions (For AI Generation)
*   **Proportions:** The matrix graphic is the "hero" image. It should look like a structured stacked bar chart but wider, representing a "field" of markets.
*   **Color Logic:** Use "Traffic Light" logic (Green = Go/Good, Yellow = Caution/Wait, Grey = Stop/Discard).
*   **Connectivity:** The numbered badges on the chart must visually correspond to the numbered text blocks on the right.

## 4. Suggested Content (Placeholder)
*   **Total Universe:** 1168 High Potential Counties.
*   **Green Block:** 273 Counties (Priority 1).
*   **Light Green Block:** 779 Counties (Secondary).
*   **Yellow Block:** 116 Counties (Tertiary).
