# Slide Layout: Cross-Functional Swimlane Process Map

**Category:** Process and Planning > Process Maps
**Use Case:** Operational Workflow, Role & Responsibility Definition, Implementation Planning
**Source:** BCGMOREMORE_Part12 (Page 27)

## 1. Context and Goal
This slide details a complex operational process involving multiple stakeholders over a specific timeline. It uses a **swimlane Diagram** (or "Rummler-Brache" diagram) where rows represent roles/departments and the horizontal axis represents time/steps. It is essential for showing *who* does *what* and *when*.

### 2. Visual Structure (Layout Description)
A matrix-like grid structure.
*   **Y-Axis (Rows):** Represent the 5 functional roles/layers.
*   **X-Axis (Columns/Phases):** Represents the process steps (Time).

### Detailed Element Breakdown

#### A. The Swimlanes (Rows - Left Side)
*   **Headers:** A vertical stack of 5 colored boxes on the far left.
    *   **Row 1 (Top):** "HQ BP" (Headquarters).
    *   **Row 2:** "M4/BU RTM Head" (Management Level 4). Use a darker green to distinguish.
    *   **Row 3:** "BU BP" (Business Unit Partner).
    *   **Row 4:** "M3/M2" (Middle Management).
    *   **Row 5 (Bottom):** "W1" (Field Sales). Use a distinct color (e.g., beige or light yellow).

#### B. The Phases (Columns - Top)
*   **Timeline Bar:** A grey horizontal bar across the top, divided into phases:
    *   **Step 1:** Preparation.
    *   **Step 2:** Execution.
    *   **Step 3:** Review/Approval.
*   **Chevrons:** Use arrow-shaped ends on the phase bar to imply forward motion.

#### C. The Process Nodes (The Boxes)
*   **Action Boxes:** Rectangular boxes placed within the intersection of a Role (Row) and a Step (Column).
*   **Content:** Short verb-driven text (e.g., "Identify Candidate", "Validate List", "Train Team").
*   **Numbering:** Small grey circles with numbers (1, 2, 3...) placed at the top-left corner of each box to indicate the exact sequence.
*   **Connectors:** Elbow lines (bent arrows) connecting the boxes in numerical order. These lines often cross between swimlanes (e.g., Row 1 connects down to Row 3).

#### D. Special Elements
*   **Decision Diamonds:** Use a diamond shape for "Go/No-Go" decisions (e.g., "Approve?").
*   **Wide Boxes:** Some actions might span the entire bottom row (e.g., "Official recruiting process - On-going"). Use a wide, continuous bar for these background activities.
*   **Icons:** Small document or person icons inside the boxes to indicate "Deliverable" or "Meeting".

## 3. Key Design Instructions (For AI Generation)
*   **Complexity Management:** This layout handles high density. Ensure the boxes are small enough to fit ~20 steps but large enough to read.
*   **Flow:** The primary visual path is left-to-right, but the lines frequently move up and down between roles.
*   **Color Coding:**
    *   **Roles:** Use shades of the corporate color (Green/Blue).
    *   **Highlights:** Use a contrasting color (e.g., Yellow/Orange) for critical approval steps or the bottom-most "On-going" layer.

## 4. Suggested Content (Placeholder)
*   **Step 1:** HQ identifies policy -> BU Head validates -> BU BP trains team.
*   **Step 2:** M3/M2 executes field visit -> W1 collects data.
*   **Step 3:** BU BP reviews data -> HQ gives final approval.
