# Slide Layout: Three-Track Evolution Path

**Category:** Process and Planning > Timelines and Roadmaps
**Use Case:** Strategic Roadmap, Phased Rollout, Multi-Segment Strategy
**Source:** BCGMOREMORE_Part12 (Page 22)

## 1. Context and Goal
This slide illustrates how three different market segments (or business units) will evolve over time. Instead of a single timeline, it uses **three parallel horizontal tracks** (swimlanes) that move from a "Blank" starting state to distinct future maturity stages. It is used to show that "one size does not fit all" and different segments have different evolution speeds and targets.

### 2. Visual Structure (Layout Description)
The slide is arranged vertically into three distinct rows (tracks), each representing a different market type.

### Detailed Element Breakdown

#### A. The Tracks (Rows)
*   **Track 1 (Top):** "Market evolution for Premium counties". Use a dark green header box on the left.
*   **Track 2 (Middle):** "Market evolution for Core counties". Use a medium green header box.
*   **Track 3 (Bottom):** "Market evolution for Hybrid counties". Use a light green header box.

#### B. The Flow (Left to Right)
*   **Start State:** A small white box labeled "Blank Stage" on the far left.
*   **Arrows:** Large, thick grey arrows connect the stages horizontally (Left -> Right).
*   **Stages:** Rectangular boxes representing future states (e.g., "Premium 1", "Premium 2", "Premium 3").
    *   **Spacing:** The boxes should be spaced out to imply time progression.
    *   **Metrics:** Below each stage box, place small text indicating the target metric (e.g., "<10%", "10-25%", ">25% Market Share").

#### C. Triggers and Conditions (The "Logic")
*   **Yellow Callout Boxes:** Small yellow boxes placed *above* the arrows between stages.
*   **Text:** These boxes contain the "Trigger" conditions required to move to the next stage (e.g., "Reach mkt share trigger = Yes", "Authorized WS = Yes").
*   **Connectors:** Small pointers from the yellow boxes to the transition arrows.

#### D. The "Split" Variation (Bottom Track)
*   **Hybrid Logic:** For the bottom track, instead of a simple linear flow, use a large text box or a split arrow indicating that this segment is a "Combination" of the behaviors of the top two tracks. (e.g., "In Hybrid model, Premium and Core stages can evolve separately").

## 3. Key Design Instructions (For AI Generation)
*   **Alignment:** The "Stage 1", "Stage 2", and "Stage 3" boxes across all three tracks should be vertically aligned to show they happen in parallel timeframes.
*   **Flow Direction:** Strong Left-to-Right visual flow.
*   **Clarity:** Ensure the "Trigger" boxes (Yellow) do not clutter the main flow arrows. They are "gates" or "checkpoints".
*   **Style:** Flat process diagram. High contrast between the dark header boxes and the white stage boxes.

## 4. Suggested Content (Placeholder)
*   **Row 1:** Premium Market -> Premium 1 (<10%) -> Premium 2 (10-25%) -> Premium 3 (>25%).
*   **Row 2:** Core Market -> Core 1 (<10%) -> Core 2 (10-25%) -> Core 3 (>25%).
*   **Triggers:** "Wholesaler Signed", "POC Coverage > 50%".
