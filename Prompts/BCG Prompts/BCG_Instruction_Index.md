# BCG Slide Layout Library: Master Index

This index serves as the central navigation for the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) style slide library. It consolidates layouts from general consulting frameworks and specific high-complexity case studies (BCGMOREMORE).

**How to use this library:**
1.  Identify the **Category** of information you need to present (e.g., Data, Process, Concept).
2.  Select the **Layout** that best fits your content density and logical flow.
3.  Use the linked `.md` file as a system prompt or instruction set for your design tool or AI agent.
