**Source:** BCGMOREMORE_Part11 (Page 34)

## 1. Context and Goal
This slide defines the "Who"—the ideal people needed to execute the strategy. It compares the formal Job Description (JD) with the "Ideal Profile" (background, experience, traits). This is used to guide HR and management in hiring or selecting internal candidates for a transformation project.

## 2. Visual Structure (Layout Description)
A symmetrical, side-by-side card layout.
*   **Vertical Sections:** Two or three main rows (one for each role, e.g., "W1" and "BU BP").
*   **Horizontal Sections:** For each role, split the slide into "Job Description" (Left) and "Ideal Profile" (Right).

### Detailed Element Breakdown

#### A. The Role Identifier (Far Left)
*   **Visual:** A tall, solid colored box spanning the full height of the role's row.
*   **Text:** Role name (e.g., "W1") rotated 90 degrees or centered vertically.
*   **Color:** Use professional shades like light green or pale blue.

#### B. The Job Description Box (Middle)
*   **Header:** "Job Description".
*   **Structure:**
    1.  **Objective:** A short bold sentence.
    2.  **Accountabilities:** A bulleted list of daily tasks and core duties.
*   **Border:** A clean, thin grey outline around the text block.

#### C. The Ideal Profile Box (Right)
*   **Header:** "Ideal Profile".
*   **Structure:** A bulleted list of qualifications:
    *   **Experience:** "3-5 years in beverage industry".
    *   **Skills:** "Intermediate English", "Expert in Excel".
    *   **Traits:** "Strong management experience".
*   **Styling:** Use a slightly different background tint or border style to distinguish it from the JD (e.g., a dashed border or a subtle shadow).

## 3. Key Design Instructions (For AI Generation)
*   **Symmetry:** The "JD" and "Ideal Profile" boxes should be equal in width and perfectly aligned at the top.
*   **Typography:** Use a clear hierarchy. Role names (Large) > Section Headers (Medium/Bold) > Bullet points (Regular).
*   **Cleanliness:** Minimize icons. Let the structured text and the clean boxes do the work.
