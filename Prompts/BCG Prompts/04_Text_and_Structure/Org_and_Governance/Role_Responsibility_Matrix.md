## 1. Context and Goal
This slide connects specific organizational roles to their key performance indicators (KPIs). It ensures that every level of the hierarchy—from Headquarters to the field—has clearly defined, measurable goals that align with the overall project strategy.

## 2. Visual Structure (Layout Description)
A clean, two-column matrix layout with a prominent header row.
*   **Left Column (Roles):** A vertical stack of colored labels.
*   **Right Column (Key KPIs):** A corresponding list of detailed metrics.

### Detailed Element Breakdown

#### A. The Role Column (Left)
*   **Shape:** Rectangular blocks with rounded corners on the outer side.
*   **Color Palette:** Use shades of green, moving from darkest at the top (HQ) to lightest at the bottom (Field).
*   **Labels:**
    1.  **HQ Blue-Print Team** (e.g., "1 dedicated FTE").
    2.  **BU Blue-Print Team**.
    3.  **SD/M4/M3/W2** (Management layers).
    4.  **W1** (Field Sales).
    5.  **WS T1/T2** (Wholesalers).

#### B. The KPI Column (Right)
*   **Alignment:** Each KPI box must align perfectly with the corresponding Role block.
*   **Content Type:** Bulleted lists.
*   **Callout Highlights:** Within the KPI boxes, use a **yellow highlight box** for critical questions or secondary metrics that require attention (e.g., "Should we put a % target for WS T1?").
*   **Formatting:** Use bold text for the metric name (e.g., **Sales Target**) and regular text for the value or condition (e.g., "50% of priority county sales").

#### C. Visual Connectors
*   **Separation:** Use thin grey horizontal lines between the rows to maintain a grid-like clarity.
*   **Grouping:** Some roles might share the same KPI box if their responsibilities are shared (use a combined row height).

## 3. Key Design Instructions (For AI Generation)
*   **Hierarchy:** The vertical flow (Top -> Bottom) should mirror the organizational seniority.
*   **White Space:** Maintain generous padding within the KPI boxes to avoid a cluttered "document" look.
*   **Legibility:** Use a clean sans-serif font. The Role labels should be centered within their colored blocks.

## 4. Suggested Content (Placeholder)
*   **HQ Team:** Overall whitespace sales target (50%), Overall RTM progress.
*   **BU Team:** Qualified WS sign-up rate, Product portfolio (15%).
*   **W1 Team:** Current Standard KPI (85%), Blue Print progress (15%).
