# Slide Layout: Organizational Hierarchy & Reporting Flow

**Category:** Text and Structure > Org and Governance
**Use Case:** Org Redesign, Span of Control Analysis, Reporting Line Clarification
**Source:** BCGMOREMORE_Part12 (Page 29 & 30)

## 1. Context and Goal
This layout visualizes the organizational reporting structure and the "span of control" (how many subordinates per manager). It combines a standard org chart with descriptive text blocks to explain the *roles* of specific management layers in a new strategic setup.

## 2. Visual Structure (Layout Description)
A split layout: **Hierarchy Diagram (Left, ~40%)** and **Detailed Role Descriptions (Right, ~60%)**.

### Detailed Element Breakdown

#### A. The Hierarchy Diagram (Left)
*   **Structure:** A vertical flow of stacked boxes.
    *   **Level 1 (Top):** "BU President" (Green box).
    *   **Level 2:** "M4 (SD)" and "BU RTM Head".
    *   **Level 3:** "M3" (Management level 3).
    *   **Level 4:** "W1" (Field sales).
*   **Connectors:**
    *   **Solid Arrows:** Traditional direct reporting lines.
    *   **Dashed Arrows:** Secondary or "advisory" reporting lines (e.g., from a central "Blue Print team" to a regional manager).
*   **Coloring:** Use distinct colors for the "New/Temporary" team members versus the "Existing/Core" management.

#### B. Detailed Role Boxes (Right)
*   **Format:** A vertical stack of large, light-blue or grey rectangular boxes.
*   **Headers:** The top of each box should have a dark header label (e.g., "HQ Blue-Print Team", "M3/W2").
*   **Content:** Bulleted lists of "Key Roles & Responsibilities".
    *   **Example:** "Control overall RTM progress", "Solve issues from the field".
*   **Alignment:** Each description box should be vertically aligned with its corresponding level in the hierarchy diagram on the left.

#### C. Span of Control Illustration (Optional/Backup)
*   **Graphic:** A circular node-and-link diagram showing one central manager node connected to 5-7 subordinate nodes.
*   **Label:** "Increase the control span of M3 to manage more W1s".

## 3. Key Design Instructions (For AI Generation)
*   **Clarity:** The arrows in the hierarchy must be unambiguous. Use line ends (heads) to show direction of reporting.
*   **Balance:** The left diagram provides the "Where", and the right text provides the "What". Ensure they are balanced in terms of visual weight.
*   **Professionalism:** Avoid "busy" backgrounds. Use a clean white slide with corporate green/blue accents.

## 4. Suggested Content (Placeholder)
*   **HQ Team:** Strategic direction, resource allocation.
*   **BU BP Team:** Screen/Qualify T1/T2, training, recruitment.
*   **W1 Team:** Routine sales activities, field data collection.
